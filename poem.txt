Its Dark in Here
by Shel Silverstein with improvements by Sarah Flesher

I am writing these poems
From inside a bear,
And it's rather dark in here.

So please excuse the handwriting
Which may not be too clear.
 
But this afternoon by the bear's cage
I'm afraid I got too near.

And I'm writing these lines
From inside a bear,
And it's rather dark in here.
